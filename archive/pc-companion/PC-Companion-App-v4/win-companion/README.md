# PC Companion App v4 (Windows)

Sends your PC's sensor readings to an AnimatedPixelClock device over your local
network (UDP), and gives you a **web-based configuration window** that mirrors the
device's own config portal 1:1 - including a live pixel-accurate OLED preview and
a drag-and-drop layout editor.

v4 is a single always-running app: the config UI is a native window (Microsoft
Edge **WebView2**, via [pywebview](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/)) backed by a
tiny `127.0.0.1` web server. Closing the window hides it to the system tray; the
monitor keeps sending in the background.

## For end users (using the .exe)

1. Double-click `pc_stats_monitor_v4.exe`.
   - First time only, Windows SmartScreen may say *"Windows protected your PC"*.
     Click **More info -> Run anyway**. This is normal for unsigned tools.
   - Requires the **WebView2 runtime** (preinstalled on Windows 11; on Windows 10
     get Microsoft's free *Evergreen* runtime if the window fails to open).
2. The configuration window opens with four sections:
   - **Connection** - device IP, UDP port, update interval, *Test connection*, and
     *Start with Windows* (autostart).
   - **Sensors** - tick which readings to send (up to 20). CPU / RAM / Disk work out
     of the box; temps, fans, GPU and power need **LibreHardwareMonitor** (see below).
     Use *Rescan sensors* after starting it.
   - **Layout & preview** - drag your chosen metrics onto the 1:1 OLED preview, pair
     companions, add progress bars, choose row mode. **Save & push to device** writes
     the config and pushes the layout to the device.
   - **Backup** - export / import the whole configuration as JSON.
3. Close the window to tuck it into the tray. Right-click the tray icon any time to
   **Configure** (reopen the window) or **Quit**.

### Hardware sensors (LibreHardwareMonitor)
For temperatures, fan RPM, GPU, power, etc. install
[LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/releases):

1. Install and run it **as Administrator**.
2. Enable the REST API: **Options -> Remote Web Server -> Run** (port 8085).
3. In the app's **Sensors** page, click **Rescan sensors**. The banner turns green
   and the new sensors appear.

### Autostart
On the **Connection** page, enable **Start with Windows**. This adds a per-user
registry entry (`HKCU\...\CurrentVersion\Run`) that launches the app minimized to
the tray at login, after a 10s delay so LibreHardwareMonitor can start first. No
administrator rights required.

### Where settings and logs live
For the `.exe`, both live in `%APPDATA%\PCStatsMonitor\`:
- `monitor_config.json` - your saved configuration
- `monitor.log` - runtime output (useful for debugging autostart)

## Running from source (development)

Requires Python 3.10+ on Windows.

```bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python pc_stats_monitor_v4.py               # opens the config window + tray
python pc_stats_monitor_v4.py --minimized   # start hidden in the tray (autostart)
python pc_stats_monitor_v4.py --autostart enable   # register run-at-login
```

In script mode, config/log are written next to the `.py` instead of `%APPDATA%`.
If `pywebview` is not installed, the app still serves the UI and opens it in your
default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8736/`.

### Building the .exe

```bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install pyinstaller
build_exe.bat
```

Output: `dist\pc_stats_monitor_v4.exe` (single self-contained file). The build
bundles the `webui/` folder and the pywebview WebView2 backend.

### How the web UI is built
`webui/portal.css` and `webui/portal.js` are extracted from the firmware's
`src/web/web_pages.h` so the desktop UI stays 1:1 with the device portal;
`portal.js` is then adapted for the PC (sensor selection, connection, autostart;
the ESP-only OTA / factory-reset blocks removed). `webui/index.html` is the
PC-tailored page. The Python side (`server.py`) implements the same REST endpoints
the JS calls; `app_window.py` hosts it all in the pywebview window + tray.

---

## Architecture (one process, several threads)
- **main thread:** pywebview window (required on Windows).
- **http-server thread(s):** `server.py` on `127.0.0.1` - serves `webui/` and the
  REST API (`/metrics`, `/save`, `/api/sensors`, `/api/select`, `/api/connection`,
  `/api/test`, `/api/autostart`, `/api/export`, `/api/import`, `/api/status`).
- **monitor thread:** reads the live config from the shared state and sends UDP
  every interval.
- **tray thread:** pystray icon (Configure / Quit).
- All shared state goes through an `RLock`-guarded manager (`app_state.py`). Window
  show/hide/quit calls are funneled through the `gui_*` chokepoint.

The UDP wire-protocol `version` stays **2.2** (the contract the firmware speaks);
the config-file/product version is **4.0**.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Window doesn't open / blank window:** install the WebView2 runtime (Win10), or
  run from source - the app falls back to opening the UI in your browser.
- **"Windows protected your PC":** click **More info -> Run anyway** (unsigned exe).
- **No hardware sensors:** start LibreHardwareMonitor as Administrator, enable
  **Options -> Remote Web Server -> Run**, then **Rescan sensors**.
- **Device shows nothing:** confirm the device IP is correct, both devices share the
  network/subnet, and Windows Firewall isn't blocking outbound UDP. Use *Test
  connection*.
- **Autostart didn't trigger:** check `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\PCStatsMonitor`
  and read `%APPDATA%\PCStatsMonitor\monitor.log`.


## GIF animations

Use the **Animations** tab after saving your clock address on **Connection**.
Refresh storage, select a GIF, choose framing and palette, then create a preview
and upload. Automatic frame skipping fits short clips to the clock's free space.
**Play** tests the clip immediately; select it and save in the device's ambient
settings to keep that choice. Raw GIFs are converted locally to the PCA format.

For an independent configuration alongside another monitor application, set
`PIXELCLOCK_CONFIG_DIR` to an absolute directory before starting the executable.
The directory holds `monitor_config.json` and logs. Without this override,
existing configuration locations remain unchanged.
